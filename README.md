# Evento - Event Management App

[Live Demo](https://evento-abhie-tripathi.vercel.app/)

## Overview

Evento is an Event Management App built using Next.js 14 with the App Router framework for React. It leverages server-side rendering (SSR) provided by Next.js, ensuring efficient performance and improved SEO for the application.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Next.js provides server-side rendering, allowing pages to be rendered on the server before being sent to the client. This improves performance and ensures that search engines can easily index the content. Server-side rendering is beneficial for dynamic and personalized content, providing a faster initial page load.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
